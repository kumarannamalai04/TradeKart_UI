          <div class="fontit padtop20">There was a cricket tournament of one month duration and a village team would like to participate in the tournament. It costs 500
INR for registration and the winner would be awarded Rs 3000 prize money.
</div>
<div class="padtop20 colyed">
  <img width="100%" src="assets/images/a2.png" alt="TRADEKART">

<div class="padtop20 ">
  But the barrier was registration fees, 500 rupees. A group of teenagers badly wanted to arrange 500 rupees to get participate in the
tournament. Each one of them asked for Rs 500 from their parents and relatives. Unfortunately, none of the parents or relatives had
shown an interest to help them.
</div>






<div  class="padtop20"><i>
“ Did your father give you money ? “<br>
<b>“ No “</b><br>
“ What about you ? “ <br>
<b>“ I didn’t even get a single penny “</b><br>“ Ask your aunt, she may help you. “
<br></i>
<br>
Unfortunately, everybody has got the same answer,<br><span class="colyed">
“ What -- Cricket tournament -- 500 rupees !! -- When is your exam? -- Go and study “</span><br><br>

One of the smart guys from the team has come up with an idea. There is no point in asking for a huge amount of money from our
parents. We are 11 members,<br><br>

“ Why can’t we arrange 50 rupees each ?“<br>
That makes sense. They started working on it and each member has arranged 50 rupees and they have enrolled for the champion-
ship.
<br><br>
This is actually a typical fundraising process. One of the team members was myself, that was the first fundraising I have done in my
life by arranging 50 rupees to participate in a cricket tournament. Most of us will do fundraising in multiple ways.
<br><br>
We can raise a fund of 1 lakh in multiple ways,<br><br>

<span class="colyed">1: Collect 25000 rupees from 4 people ( 4 * 25000 = 1 Lakh ) Or<br>
2: Collect 10000 rupees from 10 people, ( 10 * 10000 = 1 Lakh ) Or<br>
3: Collect 5000 rupees from 20 people ( 20 * 5000 = 1 Lakh )</span>

Even the stock market does the same thing. In a single line statement,

<div class="text-center padtop40 colyed">
  <span class="borpor">“ Stock market is a platform which helps companies to raise funds “ </span>
</div>

<div class="padtop20"><i>“ Ohh, now I got it. “




<br>
<b>“ What is that ? “</b><br>
“ Someone associated with stock market has plenty of funds with them “ <br>

</div>


<div class=" padtop20">All businesses start small — whether they begin in a garage, a spare bedroom, or a rented office. As companies begin to grow, they
often need more money ( known as capital ) to expand the business and afford their growing needs, such as hiring more employees,
buying computer systems, purchasing other equipment, etc. Many smaller companies rely on banks to lend them money. If the
company raises the funds by getting a loan from the bank, the loan should be paid back. But growing and successful firms have other
options, too, in the financial markets.
<br><br>
	Another way to raise funds to expand their business is to come to the public market. For that, the company should list in a stock
exchange and the general public will buy the company stocks and in this way, the company will raise the capital. Unlike a bank loan,
the money that the company raises through a stock offering to the public need not be paid back because it’s not a loan. The public will
buy the company stock, these outside investors and traders continue to hold the stock or they trade the stock. </div>






<div class="text-center padtop40 colyed">
  <span class="borpor">“ A stock exchange is a place where people buy and sell company shares “ </span>
</div>



<div class=" padtop20">Stock exchanges never give money to any company, rather they provide a platform for the companies to get money from the general
public. There are many stock exchanges in India but knowing about two popular and largest stock exchanges in India would be more
than enough. </div>

<center class="padtop20">     <div><img src="assets/images/a4.png" class="img-responsive" alt="TRADEKART" style="width: 70%;"></div> </center>

<div class=" padtop20">

These are the two major stock exchanges in India, NSE and BSE, where the company can list in any one of these exchanges.
<br>
For instance, the company RE Limited is going to be public by listing in the exchange NSE, which can be categorized into

 </div>

<center class="padtop20">     <div><img src="assets/images/a5.png" class="img-responsive" alt="TRADEKART" style="width: 60%;"></div> </center>

<div class=" padtop20">
In the primary market, RE Limited gets registered and issues the shares to the public for the first time to raise money. This process is
known as Initial Public Offer ( IPO ), which happens in the primary market. In the primary market, people can buy shares directly from
the company, RE Limited.
 </div>

<div class=" padtop20">
Say, RE Limited needs to raise a capital of 100 crores. If the company wants to issue the shares at a higher price the company will have
fewer shares.
 </div>

<div class="text-center padtop20 colyed">
  <span class=""><b>“ RE Limited can raise funds of 100 Crores in different number of ways “
</b></span>
</div>

<div class=" padtop20">
Companies generally get listed on the stock exchange through the primary market route. After the IPO, the company gets listed in the
exchange. Once the company shares are available from the stock exchange, investors or traders can do the transactions ( buy or sell
the stocks ) through the stock exchange.
 </div>
<div class=" padtop20">
If the stock RE Limited is available in the exchange NSE, then people can directly buy RE Limited stocks from the stock exchange. Stock
exchanges are a secondary market.
 </div>


 <div class=" padtop20">
For instance, you bought 50 shares of RE Limited @ 100 rupees through the NSE exchange. You hold the stock for 5 days and the stock
price has moved to 120 rupees, you exit the stocks and book the profit.
 </div>

 <div  class=" padtop20 colyed">Entry price : 100 Quantity : 50 Exit price : 120<br><br>

Profit : [ Sell price - Buy price ] * Quantity<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
: [ 120 - 100 ] * 50 = 1000 rupees.</div>

  <span class=""><b>How did you make a 1000 rupees profit ?
<br>
Who gave you 1000 rupees ?

</div>


<div class="padtop20">You cannot directly walk into the NSE head office and buy the stock. You need a mediator between you and the exchange to make your
transaction complete, they are the stockbrokers or brokerage firms. Stockbroker is your gateway to stock exchanges.<br>
First and foremost you need to start an account with a brokerage firm. The Brokerage firm can offer you a trading account. You have
to provide your documents to open the trading account from the broker, after the document verification the broker will activate the
trading account. As the name stands, the purpose of trading accounts is only to trade.</div>


<div class="padtop20"><i>“ What is a trade ? “

<br>
<b>“ Any stock transactions that happens through your trading account is a trade “</b><br>

“ How many intraday trades can we do per day? “<br>

<b>“ As much as you can, you have to have enough money in your trading account “</b>
<br>

“ Can we buy and hold a stock for a long time in a trading account? “<br>

“ No, it’s not possible in a trading account “</b></i>
</div>

<div class="padtop20">You can place buy orders and sell orders through your trading account. Brokers will make money from clients as brokerage charges.
Clients should pay a brokerage fee for every executed trade they make through the trading account. Many stockbrokers will have
different brokerage schemes and they will come up with many strategies to attract the customers. The two kinds of brokers who have
different operating strategies are,</div>

<div  class="padtop20">The brokerage charges of discount brokers will be comparatively very less than the full-service brokers. The strategy is to collect a very
small brokerage fee from a large group of customers. They keep promoting their products and services to their large group of clients
and possibly they generate different sources of income. Discount brokers operate mostly in online trading platforms.<br><br>
Full-service brokerage charges are higher than discount brokers. They have a wide variety of services like investment advice,
relationship management, financial planning, etc. Sometimes they provide trading advice to generate more brokerage from the clients.<br><br>
But in today’s business, the competition is challenging between the full-service brokers and discount brokers, but that brings an
immense quality of service to the clients. The ultimate aim of any kind of broker is to provide a good quality service and generate
money from the clients because they are running a business. The full-service broker also named as Traditional brokers.</div>

<div  class="padtop20">Any kind of stockbroker should have a stockbroking license. If you want to trade the stocks from both the exchanges NSE and BSE
through your trading account, your broker should be a member of these exchanges NSE and BSE.</div>

<div class="padtop20">A trade will execute in the stock market only if the seller price and buyer price get an exact match. Every buyer is buying from a seller
which means on Monday you bought 50 shares of RE Limited from an unknown seller who was already holding RE Limited in his / her
Demat account. On Friday, you sold 50 shares of RE Limited from your Demat account to an unknown buyer which means some buyer
bought 50 shares of RE Limited from you.</div>

The above trade of RE Limited was executed when there was a buyer to buy 50 quantities and there was a seller to sell 50 quantities
and both of their prices got matched and the trade was executed. After a successful trade, the exchange has to ensure that the buyer
will get 50 shares of RE Limited in his Demat account and the seller will get 50 shares worth money from the buyer.

Brokerage firms will collect charges from both the buyer and the seller because they have executed the trade. Exchanging the shares

corporations. The two clearing corporations are NSCCL and ICCL. NSCCL and ICCL are the subsidiaries of NSE and BSE respectively.

Wednesday is ‘ T + 2 Day ‘, where the stock will be credited to your Demat account.<br>
Thursday onwards the shares will be available for a transaction.<br><br>
Saturday and Sunday are market holidays. If you buy any stock on Friday, then Friday will be the T - Day. Monday will be the T + 1 Day
